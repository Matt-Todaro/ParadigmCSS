# Contribution Guidelines
Thank you for your interest in Paradigm CSS!

This library was originally designed for my own personal use and, as such, was built for my specific use-cases.

It's inevitable that others will come up with "wish list" items for the project that I had not previously envisioned.

If this is you, let's talk.

## Pull Requests
Please know that only PRs which have been discussed ahead of time will be reviewed.

The last thing we want to happen is for you to invest any significant time in developing a new feature/capability only to find out it is incompatible with the overall roadmap.
